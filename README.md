# das-toolkit

This repo is a collection of common NPM modules and configurations I like to use when I'm developing. By adding this as a dependency, I can verify I have all the tools I need as well as the configs. Each tool is added as a peer dependency to ensure that the consumer uses them (hopefully). The configs are just a simple `require` call.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add das-toolkit --dev
```
